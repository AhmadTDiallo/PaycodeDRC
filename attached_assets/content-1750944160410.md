## We solve the 3 key barriers to financial inclusion: identity, connectivity and cost

Around the world, 1 billion have no formal identity, 3.7 billion don't have any connectivity and 1.7 billion people remain unbanked.

​

True financial inclusion should enable everybody in society to have access to financial services regardless of their income, savings or location.

###### 01

#### IDENTITY

###### 02

#### CONNECTIVITY

###### 03

#### COST

![Biometrics Identity](https://www.paycode.com/quality_auto/IMG_2902_JPG.jpg)

##### Identity

We create biometric digital identity using field teams that go to deep rural areas. We utilise tablet-based proprietary technology to capture individuals' identities and issue cards within minutes in the field. Our trained local operators register biometric and KYC data and issue cards at a rate of 5-7 minutes per user.
